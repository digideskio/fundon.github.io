### &sect; Installation via Bower

Yup that&rsquo;s right! We&rsquo;re in the bower package registry. Simply run ``bower install typeplate`` for the CSS, Sass versions and watch the magic happen. This is an example of how to include either the CSS or Sass version in your project.

**Sass**

```scss
@import "compass";
@import "[your_project_path]/reset";
@import "[root_project_path]/bower_components/typeplate/scss/typeplate";
```

Since bower allows authors to keep packages and dependencies updated easily it also overrides any custom changes made to the package(s) contents served from the components directory -used by bower to organize packages. To alleviate this frustration we've provided a variable file to override the packages opinionated defaults. Simply duplicate the ``_typeplate-vars.scss`` file and include it from your own directory (most likely your sass directory where you keep all your related sass project files.)

**Sass w/custom variable overrides**

```scss
@import "compass";
@import "[your_project_path]/reset"; // your browser reset of choice
@import "[your_project_path]/scss/typeplate-vars"; // duplicated var file outside bower's components directory
@import "[root_project_path]/bower_components/typeplate/scss/typeplate"; // the bower package directory and included file
```

**CSS**

You could also use the CSS version instead (btwâ€¦ we don't condone this method depicted below. In reality you should copy the contents of the CSS file and paste the contents in the top of your projects stylesheet):

```html
<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="[root_project_path]/bower_components/normalize-css/normalize.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="[root_project_path]/bower_components/typeplate/css/typeplate.css">
</head>
```
